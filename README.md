# LED-Block-Cipher
Hardware Implementation of Decryption by the LED Block Cipher Using FPGA

Synthesis of the decryption circuit for the lightweight block cipher LED.
Simulation Tool: Altera Quartus II.

For LED decryption's implementation, 1 round which includes Add round key, Inverse Multiplication,Inverse shift rows, and Inverse S-Box is simulated. It has 64-bit input ciphertext and 64-bit output plain text.
